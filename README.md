# BODS-Project

'Main.ipynb' is the only code file here.

A map visualization is 'delay_map_byStop.html'.

For the extension user interface, you need to run the last block in 'Main.ipynb'.

For 'location_Nottingham.csv' and 'train_test_set_Nottingham.csv', files are too big to upload, I just upload a smaller one ending with '_sample'.
